# Example env for frontend
# When running vite dev, API requests will be proxied via /api -> http://localhost:5000
# If you want to call a different backend (or build for production), set VITE_API_BASE
# Example for production:
# VITE_API_BASE=https://my.api.example.com

# By default the app will use /api which works with the provided dev proxy
VITE_API_BASE=/api
