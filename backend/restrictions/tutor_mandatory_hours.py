"""Hard restriction: tutors must teach the first and last hour of the week

If a teacher is marked as tutor for a group (teacher.tutor_group), they must be
assigned to teach that group's first hour of the week (day=0,hour=0) and the
last hour of the week (day=num_days-1,hour=num_hours-1). This is enforced as
hard equality constraints on the corresponding assignment variables.
